## About
A search engine for informed consent HRT clinics & providers written with Symfony 6 and PHP 8.

I wrote this website with the goal of making it easy for transgender and gender non-conforming people to find clinics and healthcare providers that offer informed consent hormone therapy. There are many existing resources to aid people in finding care, but I wanted to make a simple and private search engine that collated data from multiple sources.

The website currently pulls data from:
- <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&amp;ll=41.923729399958034%2C-93.68314094170074&amp;z=8">Erin's Informed Consent HRT Map of the US</a>
- <a href="https://southernequality.org/resources/transinthesouth/">Trans in the South</a>

## Roadmap
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Github Actions deployments
- [ ] Telehealth clinics
- [ ] Notifications for user feedback
- [ ] Admin management (to allow for collaboration on data maintenance)
